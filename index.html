    <p>I'm a full stack software engineer who enjoys designing innovative apps

            <img src="images/Album Commentator App Picture.png" alt="Picture of Greg's Album Art Comment App">
            <p>This is an app I built that lets users comment on albums via looking up their art by genre or style.
                To implement this, I used an api from Discogs. Even non-users can use the app to look up
                album art by genre or style, but only users can comment or like other users' posts.
                The backend is Python with Django while the frontend is html/css/JavaScript.

            <img src="images/Army Logger Picture.png" alt="Picture of Greg's Army Logger App">
            <p>This is an app I built that lets users create armies and battles, read armies and battles
                they've created, update their armies and battles, & also delete their armies and battles.
                If the armies are Confederate, German, or French in nationality, a specific picture will be displayed.
                The backend is Python with Django while the frontend is html/css/JavaScript.

            <img src="images/DIY House Show App Picture.png" alt="Picture of Greg's DIY House Show App">
            <p>This is an app I built that lets users create show listings, read their shows, edit their shows,
                and delete their shows. It also lets non-user guests see these show listings. Users can comment on
                the show listings, and only the creator of that listing will see the comment. The creator can then comment
                back, and only the commentor will see those. The backend's Javascript while the frontend's React.js.

            <img src="images/InstaGreg.png" alt="Picture of Greg's image sharing app, InstaGreg">
            <p>This is an app I built that lets users upload pictures with comments and titles to the internet which other
                users and also non-user guests can then see. It's my Instagram knockoff. Users can edit their text 
                or titles as well as delete the image and text/titles entirely. I used a bucket with Google
                in order to get this working. The backend is Node.js, MongoDB, and Express while the frontend is EJS.

    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p>I have many interests, programming being merely one of them. I enjoy playing guitar and piano, and I have
        even written about 5 albums, some of which I have recorded: <a href="https://artrock.bandcamp.com/track/ol-briar-fox">Ol' Briar Fox, a song I wrote</a>.
        I am a published poet and a book of poetry I wrote is in the Library of Congress. I recently got a 3D printer
        & I am currently enjoying painting a number of Warhammer 40,000 miniatures. Additionally, I love books and history,
        which is what I majored in in college.
